BladeAeternum_Intro Scene Template
=================================

Scene Layout:
- Arena Floor: Create a large plane or custom arena mesh at (0,0,0).
- Player: Place a player character prefab at one end of the arena (e.g., position (-5,0,0)). Attach CombatCore.cs.
- Enemy: Place an enemy character prefab at the opposite end (e.g., position (5,0,0)). Attach EnemyAI.cs and CombatCore.cs.
- HUDCanvas: Add the HUDCanvas prefab to the scene. Attach HUDController.cs and assign UI elements.

Script Linking:
- Player's CombatCore can reference ParrySystem (if present on player).
- EnemyAI references its own CombatCore.
- GameManager (singleton) can be placed in the scene or loaded at runtime.
- LoreManager and WeaponUnlocker can be added as empty GameObjects with their scripts attached.

Result:
- A functional duel scene with all core systems and UI ready for expansion.
