# ⚔️ Blade Aeternum

**“When steel meets soul, eternity begins.”**  
*Blade Aeternum* is a high-concept, soulbound action RPG forged at the intersection of art, combat, and destiny. Designed for the dreamers, the warriors, and the forgotten gods—this is not just a game. This is a **rite of passage.**

---

## 🌌 Overview

Blade Aeternum is a narrative-rich, visually striking ARPG that blends hack-and-slash mechanics with memory-bound choice architecture. Players wield *soulblades*, each representing a core fragment of their being, evolving as they make irreversible decisions in a beautifully decaying world.

## 🛠️ Core Features

- **🧠 Adaptive Narrative Engine**  
  Every choice carves your legend. Your blade remembers everything.

- **⚔️ Tactical Real-Time Combat**  
  Dance through destruction with timed parries, soul abilities, and dynamic environments.

- **💀 Permadeath Layers**  
  Some choices kill more than characters—they erase timelines.

- **🪞 Mirrorworld Architecture**  
  Blade Aeternum’s multiverse responds to *you.* Every version of you.

- **🌿 Soulbound Progression System**  
  No XP grinding. Your weapon grows as you evolve emotionally and psychologically.

## 🔮 Lore Snapshot

The world is split—not by war, but by **memory scars.** Echoes of forgotten gods and ancient dreamers haunt the land. The Blades choose only those ready to face their past, wield their truth, and cut open time itself.

You are one of them.
